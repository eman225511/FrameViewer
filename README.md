Q:Why dont all the sites work in the iframe? A:Some websites deny Iframe, meaning they want you to vist through the url.
Q:Can I go to instagram? A: Yes and no, If you tried to view a instagram page, you will see that you cant. But you can, as long as you put embed, EXAMPLE: https://www.instagram.com/p/yourlink/embed/
